/**
 * Lipo `capstone-mcp` for a universal macOS build. A no-op anywhere else.
 *
 * ## Why this exists, and why it is not `externalBin`
 *
 * tauri-cli ships every `[[bin]]` in the crate, so `capstone-mcp` reaches the
 * installers on its own. On a host build — including Windows — it is copied
 * straight out of `target/<profile>/` and nothing here is needed.
 *
 * A **universal** macOS build is the exception. Tauri lipos the *main* binary
 * into `target/universal-apple-darwin/<profile>/` and then copies every crate
 * bin out of that directory, but it does not lipo the extra ones, so they are
 * not there:
 *
 *   failed to bundle project: Failed to copy binary from
 *   "target/universal-apple-darwin/release/capstone-mcp": does not exist
 *
 * This builds both architectures and merges them into that directory, which is
 * the one thing missing.
 *
 * ## Do not solve this with `externalBin`
 *
 * It was, briefly. Declaring a crate bin as a sidecar installs the same file
 * twice and the Windows installer refuses it:
 *
 *   error LGHT0204 : ICE30: The target file 'capstone-mcp.exe' is installed
 *   in '[ProgramFiles64Folder]\Keystone\' by two different components on an
 *   LFN system: 'capstone_mcp.exe' and 'capstone_mcp'
 *
 * That is tauri-apps/tauri#14681. The declaration is both unnecessary and
 * harmful; this script is the whole of what is actually required.
