/**
 * Build `capstone-mcp` and put it where Tauri's bundler looks for a sidecar.
 *
 * `externalBin` is resolved by the **build script**, not the bundler, so a
 * missing file fails `tauri dev` as hard as it fails `tauri build`:
 *
 *   resource path `binaries/capstone-mcp-aarch64-apple-darwin` doesn't exist
 *
 * That is why this runs from `beforeDevCommand` and `beforeBuildCommand`
 * rather than being a step someone has to remember. Forgetting it would break
 * the dev loop, which is the same way the second binary broke `cargo run`
 * before `default-run` was set in Cargo.toml.
 *
 * Naming is Tauri's: the configured path plus `-$TARGET_TRIPLE`, plus `.exe`
 * on Windows.
 *
 * ## Universal macOS
 *
 * `--target universal-apple-darwin` makes the build script ask for
 * `capstone-mcp-universal-apple-darwin`, and nothing builds that for us — it
 * is `lipo` over the two architectures. Sources disagree about whether the v2
 * CLI still merges sidecars itself, so on a macOS release this writes **all
 * three** names: both per-architecture files and the merged one. They are a
 * few megabytes and it removes the question from the release path, which is
 * not a good place to find out.
 *
 * ## Sharing cargo artifacts
 *
 * The profile and `--target` are chosen to match what Tauri is about to do,
 * so the library is compiled once rather than once per target layout:
 *
 * - macOS release: per-architecture with `--target`, which is what a
 *   universal build does anyway.
 * - everything else: no `--target`, which is what a host build does.
